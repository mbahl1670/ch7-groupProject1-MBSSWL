## How this was accomplished
* Created a shared repository on GitHub with associated Project and deployed webpage
* Decided on using Bulma as a CSS framework, Bulma is a responsive mobile-first framework and optimizes for vertical reading, so by default on mobile.
* Decdied on Big Huge Thesaurus & GIPHY as the 2 API's we were going to use and established the concept of the app around what we can use them for
* Divied up tasks between group members
* Wrote the fetch requests for the API and evaluated the data they returned
* User interface allows the user to type in a word, and click buttons to search or clear the search history
* Dynamically created the Giph display area and Search History
* Search history was made interactive and can be clicked to repeat a previous search
* Color scheme and styling achieved using Bulma classes.
* Fine-tuned stying and updated alerts to modals

## Challenges
* Understanding new API's, how the work and how to interrupt & use the data they supply
* Reconcilling differing ideas on the development of the app
* Coordinating schedules / communcating with group members
* Learning a new styleing framework in Bulma

## Directions for Future Development
* Expand the search options to return more gifs for more synonyms.
* Make the user interface intuitive while simultaneously allowing end-users easy access to all the gifs they are presented in an easy-to-see fashion.
* Display information about the variety of returns (visual e.g. pie chart, graph, something).
* Enable the app to search for any type of word
* Allow the use to search for antynonms of a word
